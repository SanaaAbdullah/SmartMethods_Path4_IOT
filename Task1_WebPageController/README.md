This folder contains the first Task of the Internet Of Things path in Smart Methods company's summer training.

The task is: Creating a web page contains a controller for the robot to allow the robot to move right, left, forward, and backward. You can as well stop the robot from moving. This controller web page does nothing when you click on any arrow because it still does not have the functionalities and it is not connected to the real robot yet.
